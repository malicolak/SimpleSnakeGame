# SimpleSnakeGame
I made a Snake game with JavaScript
It is a simple snake game that can be played with arrow keys. 
An apple appears in a random position on the 2D canvas. 
As you eat the apple, the snake grows. 
The aim is to reach the highest score without the snake hitting itself. 
If the snake touches itself, the score is reset and the game starts over.
Have fun!
